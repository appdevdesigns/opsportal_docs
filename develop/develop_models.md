# Models

In most of our applications we are concerned about how to access data on the server and display that on a Client side interface.

Both our CanJS client side framework and our SailsJS server side framework offer Models to help us interact with our data.  

In this section we will talk about how to implement Models on both the Server and Client and then tie them together.


1. [create the server side Model](develop_models_01_create.md)
2. [test the server side model](develop_models_02_testServer.md)
3. [test their REST interface](develop_models_03_testBlueprints.md)
4. [update the Client side Model](develop_models_04_clientModels.md)
