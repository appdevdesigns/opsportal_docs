# Sails/Server side tests
Half of the development of our applications will happen on the server within the Sails environment.

Read up on how Sails suggests [performing tests](http://www.sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/testing).

We suggest breaking down your server side tests into the following categories:

+ [Services] (develop_testing_server_services.md)
+ Policies
+ unique Model logic
+ Controllers
