# Create An OpsTool Plugin

We package our applications into smaller npm modules that can be installed into a Sails installation.  In order to make this process easier, we created an appdev command to help create your initial npm package:
```sh
$ cd node_modules/
$ appdev plugin opstool-RBAC
   # there will be a series of questions about your npm package:
```
