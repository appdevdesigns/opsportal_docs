# Tutorial - Sprint 0


### Overview
This is our first sprint in the process of taking our design from the drawing board to an actual tool in the OpsPortal.  In this sprint we are mainly concerned with creating an initial plugin framework and creating the github project to host this tool.  After that, we will make some preparations for our different developers to divide up the project and collaborate well. 


### Prerequsite
I'm expecting that you have already walked through our [Developer Setup](../develop/develop_setup.md) process and have an existing sails directory and an OpsPortal installed.  If not, then go do that [now](../develop/develop_setup.md).


### Let's Go
