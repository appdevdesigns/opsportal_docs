# Tutorial - Create our Server Side Feature branch

### Overview
Last step we had the project in a state where we could divide the work between several developers.  In this step, we will pick up the project as a server side developer updating the code.



### Prerequsite
As a team, we try to follow this [git branching strategy](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  Be familiar with this before we get started.

### Let's Go
Since we don't have the UI design returned to us yet, we going to focus on building out the server side portion of the project.

So, let's start out creating a new feature branch (#server_api) for the work we are about to do:
```sh
# in your [plugin] directory
$ git checkout -b server_api develop
```
